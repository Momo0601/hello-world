Hi there,
I'm Momomo and I love to do a ton of stuff. A few of them are dancing, singing, reading novels, and watching movies(esp. while cuddling with boo). I am deeply devastated by this self-isolation period as a cautionary action toward precluding the spread of the COVID-19 virus. I miss a few of my friends, well basically because I only have a few friends, and most importantly I miss my boyfriend so so much it hurts. I can't wait for the virus to end and the due explanation China(the source of the virus) has to share for the chaos and grief that they have plunged the world into while they move on with their lives, taking advantage of everyone else's fear and sorrow and using us to improve their economy when they're the reason we are all in this situation.
